    <h3>3. Sharing Your Information</h3>
    <p>
      We do not rent or sell your personal contact information (such as your email address associated with your account registration) to third parties to use for their direct marketing purposes. We share personal information in the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Website Visitors and Users:</strong> One of the main purposes of having a MagicMyHouse account is to share home improvement and design ideas with others and get inspired. Through this, others have the ability to find, view, and follow your profile and public activity on MagicMyHouse and link it to your username. Other than your personal information, others who see your dashboard are publicly viewable on the Website and open to comment by other MagicMyHouse users by login in. Learn how to make these private.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Service Providers and Partners:</strong> We may share your information with service providers and partners as reasonably needed for our uses described in this Privacy Policy. We ask our service providers to limit their use of that information for use on behalf of MagicMyHouse and for improving their services and products. Only if you specifically agree to share your contact information with a third-party partner, for example, as part of a contest or promotion we sponsor with such third party, will we share your contact information with that third-party partner for their direct marketing purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In addition, we may share information about you with third-party Websites when you allow the third-party Website to receive this information from us or allow MagicMyHouse to share this information with the third party.</strong> Our Website may include third-party social media features and other third-party plug-ins and widgets. When these features are displayed on our Website, they are operated or hosted by third parties and are subject to their own privacy policies instead of this Privacy Policy. For example, you may sign-up for our Website through Facebook, Google, or Apple.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Communications</h3>
    <p>
      An essential part of our services that you sign up for when you create an account on our Website is to receive communications from MagicMyHouse through email and our Website. We communicate with you about your account, privacy, and interactions with your content. In accordance with applicable law, we may send you marketing communications (e.g., with tips, offers, and similar services) from MagicMyHouse. These communications may feature us, our Website, co-branded products and services, professionals, sellers, and other businesses on our Website.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you provide us your phone number, we may call and otherwise contact you to help you with using the Website (e.g., to discuss your home remodeling or design project, to find professionals, or to assist with your order or if you are a professional, to find products or to provide you tips about your professional profile).

Should you choose to deactivate your account or request removal of your data, we will make every reasonable effort to comply with such requests.
