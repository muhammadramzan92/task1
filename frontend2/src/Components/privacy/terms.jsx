    <h3>2. Content</h3>
    <div className="">
      <p>a. Your Content:</p>
      <p>In the use of the Services provided by MagicMyHouse, you shall have the ability to provide Input to the Services, and receive Output generated by the Services based on that Input. The combination of input and output shall constitute "Content". Ownership of all Input shall reside with you. MagicMyHouse hereby assigns to you all rights, title, and interest in and to the Output generated by the Services, subject to your compliance with these Terms. This assignment of rights includes the ability to use the Content for any purpose, including commercial purposes such as sale or publication, provided that such use is in accordance with these Terms. MagicMyHouse reserves the right to use Content for its own purposes, including to provide and maintain the Services, comply with applicable law, and enforce its policies. You shall be solely responsible for ensuring that any Content you provide does not violate any applicable law or these Terms.</p>

      <p>b. Similarity of Content:</p>
      <p>It is important to understand that, due to the nature of machine learning, the Output generated by the Services may not be unique across users. It is possible that the same or similar Output may be generated for other users or for MagicMyHouse or a third party. For instance, if you provide input to a model to “change the color of a wall to blue”, the Output you receive may be "Blue colored wall". Other users may provide similar inputs and may receive the same or similar Output. Please note that any responses generated for other users are not considered your Content.</p>

      <p>c. Use of Content to Improve Services:</p>
      <p>We may use Content that you provide to develop or improve our Services.</p>

      <p>d. Accuracy:</p>
      <p>The fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning are constantly evolving, and we strive to improve our Services to ensure they are accurate, reliable, safe, and beneficial. However, due to the probabilistic nature of machine learning, the use of our Services may result in incorrect Output that does not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts. It is important that you evaluate the accuracy of any Output for your intended use case. This evaluation may include human review of the Output.</p>

      <p>e. Use of Copyright free content:</p>
      <p>As between you and MagicMyHouse you own the Content that you generate using the platform to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

      <p>With respect to images you upload to the platform, you represent and warrant that you own all right, title, and interest in and to such images, including without limitation, all copyrights and rights of publicity contained therein. You are responsible for the Content, including for ensuring any Content Sharing does not violate any applicable law, intellectual property right of any third party, or these Terms.</p>

      <p>You agree that MagicMyHouse and our affiliates may use the Content to develop and improve the platform, including by storing your Content and associated metadata (i.e., image specifications, seeds, and text prompts) in a “history” section of your account so that you may browse and retrieve Content you previously have generated using the Services.</p>

      <p>f. Use of content:</p>
      <p>When you download an image on MagicMyHouse, you're buying an image that lets you use the image for any personal, business or commercial purposes. That means you can use our content in advertising, marketing, apps, websites, social media, TV and film, presentations, newspapers, magazines and books, and product packaging, among hundreds of other uses.</p>

      <p>g. Photo removal policy:</p>
      <p>When you, as a user, upload photos to our Website, we assure you that these photos are promptly removed from our servers. This policy is designed to protect sensitive information and ensure that such information is no longer present on our servers. We highly value the privacy and data security of our users, and this measure contributes to a secure and confidential experience on MagicMyHouse.</p>

      <p>We encourage our users to carefully review this policy and feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or comments regarding our data protection practices. Your trust and privacy are of utmost importance to us.</p>
